# First Steps

To see a list of the commands that rig provides run `rig --help`.
`rig` often offers two levels of commands which allows for grouping all actions related to a similar concept 
together. This is most evident with the commands related to a project.
           
To see detailed help about a particular command, including any available subcommands, run `rig [command] --help`.
For example, in a project directory, running `rig project --help` will show you a list of the 
project specific actions available to you, as well as other project related subcommands such as `create` and `sync`.

To see detailed help about a particular subcommand, run `rig [command] [subcommand] --help`, for example `rig project create --help`.
