# System Requirements

## Hardware

We recommend 16 GB of RAM when working with containerization / virtualization. You can certainly
get by with 8 GB but you may want to keep other applications to a minimum. It is also dependent on
the RAM configuration required if using virtualization. By default the Outrigger Docker Host is
configured to run with 4 GB of RAM.

## Software

### Mac
 
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is also required for package installation.

For Virtualization you can choose one of the following

* [VirtualBox 5.0.20+](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (the default supported option)
* [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html)
* [Xhyve](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve#installation) with [Docker Machine Xhyve](https://github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve#install)
 
### Windows

VirtualBox is required.

### Linux

Docker is required to be running as a system service.
